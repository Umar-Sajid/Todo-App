## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This app being my first ReactJS app ever has tought me a lot about. I had to understand the lifecycle of React components better in order to tackle the project as well as ReactJS hooks.

In terms of CSS, this was a challenge as well because in order to copy the provided design by Frontend Mentor, I was forced to deal with pseudo elements (for checkmark and for expanding clicklable areas around buttons etc.), CSS variables (for dark mode) and media queries.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

### Continued development

In terms of this project, in the future I would consider adding user accounts and storing tasks in database using Firebase. As of now, the data is only stored in localStorage.

Also, I built this app without any css prepocessors. In further projects, I am going to use SASS in order to expand my knowledge of CSS. Moreover, I think I want to read more about how to structure CSS to avoid spaghetti code.

This was my first app using ReactJS. My plan is to continue creating in ReactJS, start using Redux as well and maybe some ReactJS framework such as Gatsby or NextJS.

### Useful resources

- [FreeCodeCamp - drag and drop guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-add-drag-and-drop-in-react-with-react-beautiful-dnd/) - This article helped me easily implement drag and drop functionality. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
